# Potential Features

This is an unofficial and unordered list of things that we should not forget about, when planning the new product(s).

   * Flip chart type (highcharts is able to do that for single series but not for the entire chart)
       * Example: switch line chart to pie chart

   * Multiple drag'n'drop (?)
   * We are no analysis tool!
   * We want to become more proactive, only show the user what is important to him at this moment
   * Rename modules on dashboards
   * Harmonized date filter on dashboards
